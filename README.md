# Passsword-Generator

A password generator is a web application that creates a random password based on user preferences. 
This example uses HTML to create the basic structure of the page, CSS to style the elements, and JavaScript to generate the password. 
The user can select the length of the password and which types of characters (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols) to include.
When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, the JavaScript code generates a random password that meets the specified criteria and displays it on the page. 
This application is a useful tool for creating secure passwords for online accounts.
